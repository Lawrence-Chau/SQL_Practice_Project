# Just a student who loves to learn

# Here were trying to find the customer's first/last name 'Maria Miller' and email from 
# the customers table. 

# We didn't know if the table had the columns for that in the database. 
# Let's find out!
SELECT * FROM customer;

# It's there. So, let's get her email
SELECT first_name, last_name, email FROM customer
WHERE first_name = 'Maria' AND last_name = 'Miller';



# Let's retrieve unique rating types our films could have in our database
SELECT * FROM film;
SELECT DISTINCT (rating) FROM film;

# A customer is late on their movie return, and we've mailed them a letter to their
# address at '259 Ipoh Drive'. Let's call them
SELECT phone FROM address
WHERE address = '259 Ipoh Drive';


# What are the titles of the 5 shortest (in length of runtime) movies?
SELECT title, length FROM film
ORDER BY length ASC
LIMIT 5;


# If a customer wants to watch a movie that's 50 minutes or less in runtime,
# how many options does she have?
SELECT COUNT (*) FROM film
WHERE length <= '50';

# 37!


# Let's see how many films have a rating of R and a replacement cost
# between $5 andd $15
SELECT COUNT (*) FROM film
WHERE rating = 'R' AND replacement_cost
BETWEEN 5 AND 15; # 52!


# What about the names of the films that have the word Truman somewhere in the title?
SELECT title FROM film
WHERE title LIKE '%Truman%';


# We're going to reward our top 5 spending customers with a $50 visa card
# Let's find their ids
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount)
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 5;
